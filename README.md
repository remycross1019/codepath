# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: Jeremy Cross

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remy-cross-codepathgame?path=style.css%3A7%3A10

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Video Walkthrough

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   The only outside resources I used were the links provided
   in the tutorial that showed me all the possible colors I
   could use and the different features I could add.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   The biggest challenge that I faced in creating this submission was understanding the purposes of and interactions
   between the different types of files as well as the transitions between the languages for each file. Since this was
   my first time creating an app or a website and using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, my main struggles were in understanding
   the cooperation between the languages in website building. I was able to overcome this challenge by looking at each file
   individually before trying to understand the website as a whole. While I know how to code in multiple languages, the way
   these languages work is slightly different to what I am used to. In the programming I have traditionally done, usually
   you work only in one language on a project. If youâ€™re project is being coded in Python, then you are using Python. In
   this case however, the website uses different languages for the different characteristics. For instance, the HTML file
   creates the basic structure of the page. It creates the buttons and whatever words are on the page. However the site
   also implements the Javascript file and the CSS file and they each serve their own purpose in creating the game. The
   Javascript file is responsible for the functionality of the game. It allows the game to be played by having code that
   dictates how the game should work. Conversely, the CSS file has nothing to do with the gameplay and is only responsible
   for the style of the page. The CSS file is used to change fonts, colors, and the overall look of the page. Understanding
   the manner in which all of these different files interact with each other and the distinct roles that each play in creating
   the website and the game was the biggest challenge that I faced because of the way that website development differs from
   the programming styles I am more familiar with. Once I grasped each new individual language, I was able to appreciate the
   synchronicity of the distinct files in website programming.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   If this project demonstrated the basic building blocks of website development, how much more complicated does the coding
   itself get when making a more advanced and detailed website?

   How many lines of code does it take to create a website for the average online store?

   Does every website need an HTML file, a Javascript file, and a CSS file (or some variation of the languages)
   or is it possible for a website to only have an HTML file or an HTML and CSS file but not Javascript?

   What is the best way to get more involved in web development?

   How does building a website on Glitch with a simple app compare to building an app for a phone?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   The first thing I would do if I had a few more hours to work on the project is to redefine some of the rules of the game.
   Rather than a binary win/lose game, I would make the game a multiple round, percent-score game. For example, suppose there
   were five rounds of the game where each round has 10 signals. If a player got to the 8th signal on the first round, the 10th
   signal on the second round, and so on, they would eventually get a score out of 50 rather than a win or lose. This would make
   it a more comprehensive game and further test the player's memory skills. A second aspect I would add to the game would be a
   randomization of the signals so that each subsequent game and round had a different order of signals in order to add some variation.
